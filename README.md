# Omnitrix-Test-Files  
 Tests of each of the Omnitrix features seperated into projects. This repository was created to test what the ESP32 can do. If someone wants to recreate the Omnitrix project they can start from here. These projects are also helpfull if someone wants to use a different board.  
   
 TFT-eSPI user setups are added in the Supported Displays folder that can be used in the LCD desplay tests.  
   
 The following projects are used in the Omnitrix currently:  
 * Button_Interrupts (GPIO interrupts test)  
 * PNG_animation_test (Animation test)  
 * Timer_With_Epoch_Time_Interrupts_Test (Deep sleep test with interrupts)  
 * dft_test (Sound test)
