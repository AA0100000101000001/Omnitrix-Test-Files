# Omnitrix-Test-Files
## It seems that I ran into some issues with UART and SPI in my board. Currently investigating the problem cause PNG_animation_test and dft_test do not work on it
 Tests of each of the Omnitrix features seperated into projects. This repository was created to test what the ESP32 can do. If someone wants to recreate the Omnitrix project they can start from here. These projects are also helpfull if someone wants to use a different board. The following projects are used in the Omnitrix currently:  
 Button (button test)  
 PNG_animation_test (Animation test)  
 Timer_With_Epoch_Time_Test (Deep sleep test)  
 dft_test (Sound test)
